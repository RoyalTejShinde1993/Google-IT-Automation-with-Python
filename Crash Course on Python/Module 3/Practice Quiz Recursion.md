## 1 What is recursion used for?

## Answers:
            Recursion is used to call a function from inside the same function.

## 2 Which of these activities are good use cases for recursive programs? Check all that apply.

## Answers:
           Going through a file system collecting information related to directories and files.
           Managing permissions assigned to groups inside a company, when each group can contain both subgroups and users.

## 3 Fill in the blanks to make the is_power_of function return whether the number is a power of the given base. Note: base is assumed to be a positive number. Tip: for functions that return a boolean value, you can return the result of a comparison.

## Answers:
          def is_power_of(number, base):
                  if number < base:
              # If number is equal to 1, it's a power (base**0).
                  return number==1

          # Recursive case: keep dividing number by base.
            return is_power_of(number//base, base)


           print(is_power_of(8,2))     # Should be True
           print(is_power_of(64,4))    # Should be True
           print(is_power_of(70,10))   # Should be False

## 4  Recursion is a process where a function calls itself one or more times with modified values to accomplish a task. This technique can be particularly effective when solving complex problems that can be broken down into smaller, simpler problems of the same type. In the provided code, the count_users function uses recursion to count the number of users that belong to a group within a company's system. It does this by iterating through each member of a group, and if a member is another group, it recursively calls count_users to count the users within that subgroup. However, there is a bug in the code! Can you spot the problem and fix it?

## Answers:
            def count_users(group):
                count = 0
            for member in get_members(group):
                    if is_group(member):  # Proper indentation
                      count += count_users(member)  # Indented correctly
                    else:
                      count += 1  # No change needed
            return count

            # Test cases
                  print(count_users("sales"))  # Should be 3
                  print(count_users("engineering"))  # Should be 8
                  print(count_users("everyone"))  # Should be 18

## 5 In the while loops practice quiz, you were asked to write a function to calculate the sum of all positive numbers between 1 and n. Rewrite the function using recursion instead of a while loop. Remember that when n is less than 1, the function should return 0 as the answer.

## Answers
            def sum_positive_numbers(n):
                if n < 1:
                   return 0
                return n + sum_positive_numbers(n - 1)

                print(sum_positive_numbers(3)) # Should be 6
                print(sum_positive_numbers(5)) # Should be 15
